# Generalized Linear Models
Long-awaited Generalized Linear Models with non-normal loss functions are now available. In particular, three new regressors were implemented: PoissonRegressor, GammaRegressor, and TweedieRegressor. The Poisson regressor can be used to model positive integer counts, or relative frequencies. Read more in the User Guide. Additionally, HistGradientBoostingRegressor supports a new ‘poisson’ loss as well.
