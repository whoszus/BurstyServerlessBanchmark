# Prediction Latency

This is an example showing the prediction latency of various scikit-learn estimators.

The goal is to measure the latency one can expect when doing predictions either in bulk or atomic (i.e. one by one) mode.

The plots represent the distribution of the prediction latency as a boxplot.
